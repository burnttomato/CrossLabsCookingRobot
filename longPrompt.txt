### Instruction:
User: Please give me a step-by-step recipe for a Shirley Temple mocktail.
Assistant: Instructions:

Fill a glass with ice cubes. The glass can be a highball or Collins glass, or any other similar type of glass you prefer.

Pour the lemon-lime soda into the glass until it's about halfway full.

Pour the ginger ale into the glass to fill the rest of the glass.

Add the grenadine syrup to the glass.

Stir gently with a long spoon or cocktail stirrer to mix all the ingredients together. Be careful not to stir too vigorously, as it might flatten the carbonation.

Garnish the mocktail with a few maraschino cherries.

Optionally, you can also add a small amount of maraschino cherry juice from the jar to give the mocktail a more vibrant red color.

Serve and enjoy! The Shirley Temple mocktail is best enjoyed immediately while it's still chilled.
